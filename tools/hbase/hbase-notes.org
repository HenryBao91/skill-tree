** 167. HBase Snapshots
- Snapshot allow you to take a copy of table with a very small performance effect.
- Snapshot is a immutable collection of hfile and metadata.
- Both "clone" and "restore" do not require any data to be copied cause the underlying Hfiles stay unchanged.
- "export" snapshot to remote cluster has little impact on RegionServer of the local clutster.
